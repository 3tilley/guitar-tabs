[Verse 1]
     Em7                        D/F#         G
It'll be fine by dusk light I'm telling you baby
             G                           D/F#           Em
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
        Em7                             D/F#     G
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
G                             D/F#         Em7
I don't know much but there's no weight at all
 
 
[Verse 2]
       Em7                     D/F#       G
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
          G                  D/F#          Em7
'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't
     Em7                            D/F#       G
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
G                             D/F#         Em7
Something in the orange tells me we're not done
 
 
[Chorus]
Cadd9                  G
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
D                                Em7
Where the hell am I 'supposed to go?
  Cadd9
I poisoned myself again
G                       D                            Em7
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
   Cadd9                     G
If you leave today I'll just stare at the way
    D                          Em7
The orange touches all things around
    Cadd9                    G
The grass trees and dew, how I just hate you
D                             Em7
Please turn those headlights around

[Verse 3]
 Em7                               D/F#         G
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
        G                        D/F#         Em7
There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light
    Em7                       D/F#        G
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
        G                        D/F#           Em7
Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak
 
 
[Chorus]
Cadd9                  G
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
D                                Em7
Where the hell am I 'supposed to go?
  Cadd9
I poisoned myself again
G                       D                            Em7
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
   Cadd9                     G
If you leave today I'll just stare at the way
    D                           Em7
The orange touches all things around
    Cadd9                    G
The grass trees and dew, how I just hate you
D                             Em7
Please turn those headlights around

Where the hell am I 'supposed to go?

I poisoned myself again
G                       D                            Em7
